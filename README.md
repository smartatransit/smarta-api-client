The SMARTA API client is a hybrid client around the
[MARTA APIs](http://www.itsmarta.com/app-developer-resources.aspx) supplemented
with analysis of historic patterns and static schedule data our own SMARTA APIs.

## Project Maturity

SMARTA is _very_ young. Young, scrappy, and hungry. ðŸ˜Ž

## Prerequisites

You will need a [MARTA API key](https://www.itsmarta.com/developer-reg-rtt.aspx)
to fetch the live results from MARTA's base API.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'smarta_api_client'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install smarta_api_client

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
